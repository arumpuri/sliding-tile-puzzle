# sliding-tile-puzzle
A sliding-tile puzzle, or 15-puzzle, is a small
puzzle game implemented as a set of 15
numbered sliding tiles on a 4 × 4 board. One
tile is missing, allowing adjacent tiles to slide
into the empty space on the board. The player’s goal is
to move the tiles into numeric order.
Some versions of this game have fragments of a pic-
ture on the tiles that create a whole image when the
puzzle is complete.
